                      I was born in Chicago and i've lived in the city my whole life. I went to preschool twice and then started elementary school, i was in 5th grade when i transfered to a new elementary school. I started playing basketball in my new school from 6th to 8th grade. I had many highschools in mind but i ultimately chose to attend Lane Tech, my first year so far has been great and i can't wait to continue my highschool life at Lane. I don't really knoe what i want to study at college or what i want to be, i just know i want to do something big with my life.
